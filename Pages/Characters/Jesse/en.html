        <h2>Experiences</h2>
        <p>
            Worked for some time at <i>Grimoire</i>. Having memory problems, forgot about his colleague, <a hpage="Characters/Simon_Jarett">Simon Jarrett's</a> day off, scheduled for Saturday, May 2, 2015. Recalling some of that, left a message on Simon's answering machine asking him to send a mail or make a call with an explanation<sup>[2]</sup>.

            <div class="choise-holder" story-choice="email">

                <div story-option="send" > Simon did send the mail    </div>
                <div story-option="not"  > Simon did sendn't the mail </div>
