            <h2>Experiences</h2>
            <p>
                Born July 16, 1988<sup>[1]</sup> in Canada. At some point I became interested in professional photography<sup>[2]</sup>. He was also a keen geek and worked at the Grimoire store, which distributed a variety of books, comics and board games<sup>[3]</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
                On April 9, 2015<sup>[4]</sup> Simon and his close friend <a href="../Ashley_Hall/en.html">Ashley Hall</a> were victims of a traffic accident, as a result of which the girl died from hemorrhage in the lungs, and the man suffered intracranial bleeding. The assigned doctor <a href="../Erin_Peake/en.html">Erin Peake</a> instructed Simon to periodically visit the hospital to drain the cranial cavities and avoid particularly stressful situations, and stated that failure to comply could result in death<sup>[5]</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Between 27 and 30 April 2015[6], Simon was invited to participate in a research of students of York University, <a href="../David_Munshi/en.html">David Munshi</a> and <a href="../Paul_Berg/en.html">Paul Berg</a>, learning that it could lead to a complete cure.
            </p>
            <p>
                On May 2, 2015<sup>[8]</sup>, at 09:21 am, Simon woke up from a nightmare that had become a frequent occurrence since the accident<sup>[5]</sup>. The dream was interrupted by a call from an unknown number, the caller identified himself as David Munshi, reminded me of a brain scan scheduled in a few hours and reminded me to drink a special marker liquid for better scan quality. Along the way, at 10:12 am, Simon received a call from <a href="../Jesse/en.html">Jesse</a>, a colleague at Grimoire. The call could have been accepted, dismissed, or ignored<sup>[0]</sup>. Jesse told him about <a href="../Matt/en.html">the new guy at work</a> and promised to pay his lunch in case if Simon didn't send him the email reminding him to skip work from his computer<sup>[0]</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Arriving at the PACE laboratory, Simon was faced with an empty reception room and a combination lock. When he tried to call Munshi, he also discovered that doctor's phone was turned off. Simon either tried all the combinations until he guessed the code, or rummaged through Paul Berg's laptop and belongings and found code <b>2501</b> in the notebook<sup>[0]</sup>. Having found David, Simon listened to an apology for the inconvenience. Simon had the opportunity to ask about a general description of the entire upcoming process, but nothing prevented him from immediately taking the chair in the center of the room<sup>[0]</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the neurograph landed on Simon's head, he answered formal questions, joked about Indians believing in cameras that steal people's souls, closed his eyes and began silently observing the many lights. At the end of the procedure, Simon described felt sensations as funny<sup>[8]</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
                By May 20, 2015, David and Paul had finalized their treatment plan, having received all due confirmation from Erin Peake and Mr. Way, their professor<sup>[8]</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
                On June 1, 2015, everyone was faced with the fact that the treatment had failed. While lying in the hospital, Simon thanked David for all his efforts and allowed his scan to be used in future studies<sup>[8]</sup>. Later that day Simon Jarrett died.
