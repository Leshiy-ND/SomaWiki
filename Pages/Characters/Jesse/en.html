        <h2>Experiences</h2>
        <p>
            Worked for some time at <i>Grimoire</i>. Having memory problems, forgot about his colleague, <a href="../Simon_Jarett/en">Simon Jarrett's</a> day off, scheduled for Saturday, May 2, 2015. Recalling some of that, left a message on Simon's answering machine asking him to send a letter or make a call with an explanation<sup>[2]</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Receiving email from Simon / not finding Simon at work<sup>[0]</sup> on the morning of said day, he called him at 10:12, wished him good luck and promised a free lunch, in case of not receiving any mail. At the same morning received help in the store with something from <a href="../Chris/en">Chris</a> and <a href="../Matt/en">the "new minion"</a><sup>[2]</sup>.
